# Intro
The BC Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP) is an economic immigration program. It lets the Province select economic immigrants who will live in B.C. and help fill job vacancies or operate businesses.  
  
If you are nominated, you and your family can apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for permanent residence in Canada.
# Streams
The BC PNP has two main components:
- [Skills Immigration](https://www.welcomebc.ca/Immigrate-to-B-C/Skills-Immigration) is for workers and recent graduates with the skills, experience and qualifications needed by B.C. employers
- [Entrepreneur Immigration](https://www.welcomebc.ca/Immigrate-to-B-C/Entrepreneur-Immigration) is for experienced entrepreneurs who intend to create and actively manage a business in the province

## EEBC
if you will use the EEBC option
Before you begin, carefully review the information about the Skills Immigration streams to find the stream that best fits your situation.

Four of the Skills Immigration streams also have the EEBC option. You might be eligible for the Express Entry BC option if you are in the federal Express Entry pool and you meet the criteria for one of the Skills Immigration streams. 

If you are nominated using the Express Entry BC option, your federal profile will receive more points and your federal permanent residence application may be processed faster.

When you have chosen your Skills Immigration stream, and you have decided if you will use the EEBC option, you are ready to register

**If you decide to use the EEBC option, select the stream that starts with Express Entry BC. This ensures your nomination will connect to your IRCC profile in the Express Entry system.**
