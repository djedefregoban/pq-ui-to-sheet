# ALWAYS UPDATE FIRST

# What to care about
1. Give a different session for each client to prevent manipulation

# Procedure
1. Email to the PQ Question Form
2. The form determines which PQ to send
3. Send Google Form to fill out the PQ
4. PQ automatically sent back to us in pdf to the correspond dropbox
5. if client doesn't do PQ within a certain amount of time, auto-follow-up

# Sender
1. Enter Client ID and PQ info on the website
3. Find the client on Notion using client ID
4. Create a task linked to the client specifying how pqs have been sent (timestamp! no check off!)
e.g.,
- Title
BOT: Send PQ - 3 PQ(s) have been sent (# set up date and dont check off the mark)
- Content
PA - Loviisa (General) - Sent
Spouse - Spouse or Common-partner of Loviisa (General) - Sent
Supporter - Shimmel - (PGP) - Received
...

2. Using PQ info, create entries based on each client and update pq status's form internal link
- create entry with taskid attached to it
5. Upload the JSON to the task

## Remarks
- Format the email
- Think about error checks more

# Watcher
1. Upon cathing an update, find the task using taskID coming from PQ info 
2. get the JSON in the task and look for the client using internal link
3. Update ifReturned to true from false (# will there be any situations where ifReturned is originally true?)
4. Send thank you email to the just completer (if the relationship is applicant, and the form has refusal etc. include those stuff into the email)
4. look through every ifReturned to check if every pq has been received (# make a function for this)
- if yes,
	1. using the task id, check off the mark of the task
	2. create another task linked to the client indicating every pq has been received (timestamp!)

- if no,
	do nothing?

# Reminder
1. look through bot tasks (if not checked off and timestamp has been more than a certain time amount)
2. send a remind email containig the pq status (using JSON!)

1. Date of completion
